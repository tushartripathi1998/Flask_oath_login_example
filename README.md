Create a basic google login : oauth using flask.
Don't forget to mention your client id in /template/index.html.

Add on tip : Not to forget, that google does not prefers address in such form - http://127.0.0.1:port_number, rather it prefers this : 
http:localhost:port_number(by default '5000' for flask), that unfortunately isn't mentioned in the docs !
